# Agent Context

Frontend app for the equipment rental platform built with TanStack Start, React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4, Vitest, and Biome.

Run commands from `apps/web/` unless there is a clear reason to do otherwise.

Use `pnpm`.

Common app commands:

- `pnpm dev`
- `pnpm build`
- `pnpm test`
- `pnpm lint`
- `pnpm check`

Use local config and nearby code as the primary source of truth:

- `package.json`
- `biome.json`
- `tsconfig.json`
- `vite.config.ts`

Use `docs/agent-rules/` for app-specific implementation rules and workflows.

Always start with `docs/agent-rules/architecture.md`, then load any additional relevant documents from `docs/agent-rules/` based on the area you are changing.

Use existing skills for specialized workflows:

- `react-modular-architecture` for substantial React feature work
- `tanstack-query` for TanStack Query and server-state patterns
- `react-use-effect-guard` for React component and hook work
- `css-layout-guide` for layout and Tailwind structure decisions
- `zustand-store-design` for Zustand store design or review

Do not hand-edit generated files such as `src/routeTree.gen.ts` unless the task explicitly requires it.
