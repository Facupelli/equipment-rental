# Rental Orders And Fulfillment

This document explains how orders, booking mode, assignment stage, bundles, and delivery fit together in the rental domain.

## Orders As Commercial Commitments

`Order` represents the rental agreement the business accepted.

An order belongs to:

- one tenant
- one location
- optionally one customer

It contains `OrderItem[]`, one shared booking period, and booking metadata that preserves how the rental was requested.

The key shape is:

- one order has one rental period
- all order items share that order-level period
- an order may mix product and bundle items
- the booking snapshot preserves the local booking inputs used at checkout

Items describe what was bought, but the booking window belongs to the order as a whole.

## Order Items

`OrderItem` is the line-level boundary between what the customer bought and how the system fulfills it.

Each order item is either:

- `PRODUCT`
- `BUNDLE`

An order item references either `productTypeId` or `bundleId` and stores `priceSnapshot` so pricing remains historically correct even if catalog pricing changes later.

Asset assignments attach at the order-item level, which allows one order to contain multiple independently fulfilled lines.

## Booking Snapshot And Fulfillment Method

Orders keep a booking snapshot that preserves:

- pickup date
- pickup time
- return date
- return time
- timezone used to interpret those values

Orders also carry a fulfillment method:

- `PICKUP`
- `DELIVERY`

If the order uses delivery, it also carries an `OrderDeliveryRequest` with recipient and address details.

For actor boundaries between customer-facing and admin-facing order flows, see `user-customer-auth.md`.

## Booking Mode And Initial State

The initial order status depends on tenant booking mode:

- `INSTANT_BOOK` creates the order as `CONFIRMED`
- `REQUEST_TO_BOOK` creates the order as `PENDING_REVIEW`

That distinction matters because acceptance and physical reservation may be tentative or committed depending on booking policy.

## Order Lifecycle

The current status model is:

- `PENDING_REVIEW`
- `CONFIRMED`
- `REJECTED`
- `EXPIRED`
- `ACTIVE`
- `COMPLETED`
- `CANCELLED`

The valid transition shape is:

- `PENDING_REVIEW -> CONFIRMED | REJECTED | EXPIRED`
- `CONFIRMED -> ACTIVE | CANCELLED`
- `ACTIVE -> COMPLETED`

This reflects a workflow where review and acceptance may be separate from final operational execution.

## Assignment Stage

Asset assignments remain the physical reservation primitive, but the current model adds an assignment stage:

- `HOLD`
- `COMMITTED`

Assignment stage is driven by booking mode:

- request-to-book orders start with `HOLD` assignments
- instant-book orders start with `COMMITTED` assignments

Lifecycle actions update order state and reservation state together:

- confirming a pending-review order promotes assignments from `HOLD` to `COMMITTED`
- rejecting or expiring a pending-review order releases held assignments
- cancelling a confirmed order releases committed assignments
- activating and completing an order advance fulfillment lifecycle around already committed assignments

So the current fulfillment story is centered on tentative versus committed reservation, not on a generic sourcing status.

## Assignment Source

`AssignmentSource` still records where fulfillment came from:

- `OWNED`
- `EXTERNAL`

This supports procurement tracking and downstream financial logic, but it is secondary to assignment stage in the current operational model.

## Bundles In Orders

Bundles are sellable catalog objects, not special inventory entities.

That means:

- customers can rent a bundle as one order item
- the system still fulfills it using the component product types inside the bundle
- bundle booking eventually results in asset assignments against concrete assets

Bundles are snapshotted at booking time through:

- `BundleSnapshot`
- `BundleSnapshotComponent`

This preserves booked composition and bundle-level price even if the catalog definition changes later.

## Bundle Availability

A bundle is fulfillable only if all required component quantities can be satisfied for the requested period.

So bundle availability is effectively an AND across all required component lines, each evaluated against real asset availability.

Mixed orders are valid. An order may contain a bundle item, a standalone product item, or even a product that also appears inside the bundle.
